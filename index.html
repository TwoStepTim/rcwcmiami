                     Engagement refers to the active involvement and participation of individuals, communities,
                     and organizations in child welfare initiatives. It encompasses various aspects, including
                     families, caregivers, educators, case managers, child welfare professionals, and community
                     members, all working together to ensure the safety and well-being of children within our

                       <h2>Allison Schild</h2>
                       <p>Allison Schild is a mother, a nurse, a Certified Recovery Peer Specialist, and a Parent Advocate in the child welfare system. In 2016, her child was placed into the foster care system. After a year-long dependency case, she was reunified with her daughter and has maintained sole custody, as well as her sobriety.
                        Allison has been a parent leader since 2019. She quickly realized the minimal biological parent representation there was within the child welfare system and the behavioral health service network. She made a commitment to lift the voice of parents within the system by sitting on as many boards, advisory committees, and invested stakeholder meetings as she could. Today, Allison is the Parent Engagement Manager at Citrus Family Care Network, the lead CBC in Miami Dade and Monroe County where she is working to advance the work of Peers and parent representation in child welfare.
